                Sindhutai Sapkal affectionally called Mai by her many children was unlike anybody else. 
                She took care of thousands of orphans, fought for the rehabilitation of 84 Adivasi villages,
                and adopted all the orphan children from affected Adivasi tribes to give them a better life.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">She knew she wanted to help others life her. Her own painful journey 
                was a lesson to her, which made her empathise with other unfortunate children. She devoted her 
                entire life to her orphans. She loves, nurtures, and protects her children despite the fact that 
                she has no steady means of income.

          <p style="text-align: justify;">There was a flower but I could not smell it, It rained but I didn't get
             drenched, The moon was sparkling but I couldn't take a bath!‚Äù This are the lines spoken by Sindhutai 
             when she describes her life.
